# Bigfoot Sightings

This was a one-day case-study that dealt with a data set of bigfoot sighting reports that was collected from the [Geographic Database of Bigfoot / Sasquatch Sightings & Reports](http://www.bfro.net/gdb/); you can see an example report [here](http://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=13038).

The goal was simply to find something interesting in the data, with a huge part of the challenge being getting the data into a usable form.
